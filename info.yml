display_name: "Desktop Startup Framework"
description: "Startup logic for the PTR desktop app"

# Required minimum versions for this item to run
# Do not update this core version, or the upgrade of the PTR desktop app
# startup code will fail.
# When the PTR desktop app starts, it uses the core that is packaged with
# the desktop app to bootstrap and do an auto-update. After the update
# has been pulled down, we compare the version of the core used to download
# the update with this number here. If we dump this version here to something
# more recent, then the update will fail to install since the descriptor
# will complain that the current core is older than "requires_core_version".
